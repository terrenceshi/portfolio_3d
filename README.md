## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Look at different colors for Art page

Art
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)
 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to fade out

Music
 - Add some cool effects for playing track

CS
 - Image load?

Misc
 - Navbar currently gets overlayed when u scroll under it. Make it look pretty. 
 - Look into why sometimes menu link does not work
 - figure out how to deal with height discrepency (laptop has about 800 height)
    - landing screen uses different padding top value depending on device
    - on desktop, artbox can go up to 650 width but gotta shave it down for laptop
        - maybe create some algorithm to calculate an images dimensions and see how much you can fit
    - music padding on footer is extremely awkward
        - making ONE song or sample would solve this issue.

 - look up use of chromatic abberation for fun
