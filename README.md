## TO DO:

 - make two songs to make music height discrepency better

 - Improve run time by looking into this: https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx

 - Try to fix navbar blur transition

 - art height discrepency
    - either hardcode since height pixel values 
    - or change the containers transition property such that it wont transition on width change

 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)

 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)

 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to fade out

 - look up use of chromatic abberation for fun
