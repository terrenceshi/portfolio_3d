## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Look at different colors for Art page

Art
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)
 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to fade out

Music
 - Add some cool effects for playing track

CS
 - Image load?

Mobile
 - Do some quick testing make sure its good!

Misc
 - Navbar currently gets overlayed when u scroll under it. Make it look pretty. 
 - Look for onCanvas load type thingie. Threejs canvas wont load easily for everyone.
 - Check to see if vh padding works well on laptop

 - look up use of chromatic abberation for fun
