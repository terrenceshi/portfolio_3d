## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Experiment with different options for Art Background (optional) (new color? maybe a model from vg design?)
 - look into having box not receive bloom
 - play with music and cs lights so that the models receive bloom
 - look up use of chromatic abberation for fun

Art
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)
 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to fade out

CS
 - Layout is more or less complete. 
    - Main con is the fact that not much information can be put in. 
    - This con would be offset by having projects with external pages (put back improved B2N + another)
    - The alternative is to have an earnest article and let the user be able to scroll in CS (con is lack of monster model)

Music
 - Decide if you really want to replan whole structure of project so that player can be absolute
 - Add some cool effects for playing track

Mobile
 - Not only change width of elements, but also change camera locations of scenes

Misc
 - Navbar currently gets overlayed when u scroll under it. Make it look pretty. 
 - Check to see if vh padding works well on laptop
