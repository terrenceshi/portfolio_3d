## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add bloom effect for landing page
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Experiment with different options for Art Background (optional)
 - Look into post effects and see what can be done

Art
 - Implement Artbox (could copy paste, but at least add improvement for showing year)
 - Add loading
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)

CS
 - Figure out layout for article and such
 - Make articles data-able
 - Implement slider for different articles

Music
 - Implement whole fking thing lol

Animations
 - Pages should transition when switching. (probably opacity, i think howtoselldrugsonline does that)
 - Look into implementing: https://mui.com/material-ui/transitions/

Mobile
 - Not only change width of elements, but also change camera locations of scenes
 - Art: change layout when in mobile
 - CS: figure out how to not spill a shit load of text when screen gets smaller

Misc
 - Navbar currently gets overlayed when u scroll under it. Make it look pretty.
