## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Experiment with different options for Art Background (optional) (new color? maybe a model from vg design?)
 - look up use of chromatic abberation for fun

Art
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)
 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to fade out

Music
 - Add some cool effects for playing track

CS
 - Image load?
 - refactor cs code to make it not look ugly as fuckign sin

Mobile
