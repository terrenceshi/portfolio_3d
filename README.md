## TO DO:

Scene
 - Add bloom effect for landing page (hard as fuck haha why is threejs dumb)
 - Add lights from cars (hard as fuck, may need to download a new package for this one)
 - Experiment with different options for Art Background (optional)
 - Look into post effects and see what can be done

Art
 - Should have boxes pop up on scroll (any page that requires scrolling should)
 - improve loading / not loading lerp (could use a timer before lerp just to see if images are loaded)
    - Could consider having a timer before every lerp to turn off all lights (me thinks probably not though)

CS
 - Layout is more or less complete. 
    - Main con is the fact that not much information can be put in. 
    - This con would be offset by having projects with external pages (put back improved B2N + another)
    - The alternative is to have an earnest article and let the user be able to scroll in CS (con is lack of monster model)

Music
 - Figure out how to implement player
    - Could just give footer huge padding when on music page and put player at the bottom, absolute style
 - Add some cool effects for playing track

Mobile
 - Not only change width of elements, but also change camera locations of scenes
 - Art: change layout when in mobile
 - CS: figure out how to not spill a shit load of text when screen gets smaller

Misc
 - Navbar currently gets overlayed when u scroll under it. Make it look pretty.
